# FinnActivity15

Repository for Activity 15 by Nicholas Finn to practice using GitHub and version control.
Data used includes Armed Forces Data from a Google sheet and the Baby Names data from the dcData package.
The current plan for the project is to add in the Activity 14 files and then move into the issues and branches to complete all parts of the project.
